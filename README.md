# What is this?
It's a site that lets you upload a Project Arrhythmia level file (.lsb/vgd) and see some cool stats about it. Want to know how many times you used the Linear easing? How many objects you have? The amount of parent objects? The object with the most children? You can do it here.

Future plans:

If you have any ideas that aren't here and are interesting, let me know.
