# What is this?
It's a site that lets you upload a Project Arrhythmia level file (.lsb/vgd) and see some cool stats about it. Want to know how many times you used the Linear easing? How many objects you have? The amount of parent objects? The object with the most children? You can do it here.

Future plans:
- make it work
- Object heatmap
- Most/least used easings
- Most/least parented to objects
- Quick actions:
  - All objects to decoration
  - Fix text on Alpha
  - Remove unused themes from Alpha levels
  - Extract themes/prefabs from a level
If you have any ideas that aren't here and are interesting, let me know.
